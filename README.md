# Culture Decks

### What is a culture deck? 

At its most basic, a culture deck is a slideshow that breaks down your company's culture, core values, and mission into clear, easy-to-absorb pieces. 

Netflix kick-started the online culture deck trend by posting their unique company culture deck online, as a means of communicating their culture to new and current employees, customers, and partners. As of this writing, this deck has been viewed over 17m times on Slideshare and Sheryl Sandberg called it “probably the most important document ever to come out of the valley”. 

There is no simple formula for creating a great company culture, and you definitely can't copy another company's culture, but you can learn from how other companies have created a meaningful and effective culture deck.
